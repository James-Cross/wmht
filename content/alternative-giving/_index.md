    The number of people sleeping rough on our streets has increased significantly in recent years.


    The knock on effect is increased pressure on the support network that helps rough sleepers, teams that are committed to working with individuals to provide accommodation, hot meals, medical treatment and ultimately a better future.


    That’s why we invite you to join us in working together so that every member of the community can turn small change into big change.

    [Change into Action](https://changeintoaction.org.uk) is an alternative giving scheme that provides a safe, easy and secure way to donate money to fund practical support for people who are or have been rough sleeping across the WMCA region. Change into Action brings together partners from key local organisations, such as specialist homelessness charities and street teams that work with individuals to identify practical measures that can really make a difference and help make that move away from the streets. 


    The scheme is administered and managed locally in Birmingham, Coventry, Dudley, Sandwell, Solihull and Walsall; with Wolverhampton having a similar initiative known as [Alternative Giving CIO](https://wolverhamptonchange.co.uk).
