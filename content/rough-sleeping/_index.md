    The Homelessness Taskforce’s Rough Sleeping Task Group is working to coordinate activity to end rough sleeping across the WMCA region.  Currently the group is working with the Centre for Homelessness Impact as one of five early adopter areas to define what it will mean to successfully end rough sleeping. 


    Our goal and the definition that we have co-designed as part of the early adopter work is to ensure that rough sleeping is prevented wherever possible, so it is rare, and where it occurs it is a brief and non-recurring experience.


    We are testing out an approach with the Centre for Homelessness Impact and the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC) to better track progress towards ensuring that rough sleeping is prevented as much as possible and is measurably rare, brief and non-recurring, and to use this to understand challenges and learn from what is working.  


    This early adopter initiative is the first both to introduce a simple and memorable definition of ending rough sleeping and develop meaningful indicators that can help to drive forward efforts to achieve this.

      In 2018 we secured Government funding alongside Greater Manchester and Liverpool to pilot the Housing First approach across the region. 

      
      Pioneered in the USA and central to the national homelessness strategies in Canada, Denmark, Finland and France; Housing First is underpinned by the principle that everyone has the right to a home which provides them with security giving them a better chance of conquering health and other challenges.

      
      The Housing First approach represents a significant departure from traditional ‘linear’ models for provision of housing for people experiencing homelessness, multiple disadvantage and serial exclusions. 

      
      To date the West Midlands Housing First pilot has supported over 500 individuals into independent accommodation with wrap-around support to re-build their lives and stay in their accommodation. 

      
      The WMCA Homelessness Taskforce commissioned Campbell Tickell to undertake some research to capture key learning from our pilot. An executive report and full report are available for further information about our pilot.
