    The Homelessness Taskforce’s Rough Sleeping Task Group is working to coordinate activity to end rough sleeping across the WMCA region.  Currently the group is working with the Centre for Homelessness Impact as one of five early adopter areas to define what it will mean to successfully end rough sleeping. 


    Our goal and the definition that we have co-designed as part of the early adopter work is to ensure that rough sleeping is prevented wherever possible, so it is rare, and where it occurs it is a brief and non-recurring experience.


    We are testing out an approach with the Centre for Homelessness Impact and the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC) to better track progress towards ensuring that rough sleeping is prevented as much as possible and is measurably rare, brief and non-recurring, and to use this to understand challenges and learn from what is working.  


    This early adopter initiative is the first both to introduce a simple and memorable definition of ending rough sleeping and develop meaningful indicators that can help to drive forward efforts to achieve this.
