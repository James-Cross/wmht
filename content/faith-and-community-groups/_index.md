    We recognise the importance of working in partnership with faith and community groups to design, coproduce and deliver new approaches to the prevention of homelessness. 


    Since 2020 we have appointed a Faith and Communities Development Officer for homelessness based at the WMCA to help build our approach. This role is central to our Commitment to Collaborate with faith and community groups to design out homelessness across the region.


    As part of that collaboration there is a clear offer to faith and community groups to work together with us to design and offer targeted support and activities, promoting best and safe practice and greater integration with local authority and statutory pathways so that meaningful support for people experiencing homelessness can be developed.
