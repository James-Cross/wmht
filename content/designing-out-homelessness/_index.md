    The WMCA Homelessness Taskforce’s strategic objective is to design out homelessness,  in all its forms, and to promote sustainable and meaningful INclusion for all citizens.

    
    The Taskforce considers that  this ambitious objective can only be achieved through a shared cross sectoral approach to tackling structural inequalities focussing on how service systems respond to people’s needs and how service systems inter-relate with each other.
