    Our work with the business community has taught us that businesses have a wider purpose; as employers they can contribute to our ambition of Designing out Homelessness because access to good employment can act as a preventative measure as well as a sustainable route out of homelessness. 


    Working with Business in the Community and Gowling WLG we have brought together  practical steps that businesses can take to help prevent and tackle homelessness. These steps have been compiled into a toolkit to support employers to consider how they can implement actions as part of their day to day activities, to prevent homelessness within their workforce, give practical help to employees when issues arise, and create pathways to employment for people who have experienced homelessness.
