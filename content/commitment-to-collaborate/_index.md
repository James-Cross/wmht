    The Commitment to Collaborate (C2C) to Prevent and Relieve Homelessness Toolkit has been developed by the WMCA Homelessness Taskforce in partnership with Birmingham Voluntary Service Council (BVSC) to support organisations and partnerships across the region to think about what actions they can take to prevent and relieve homelessness.


    The toolkit provides an overview of homelessness in its widest sense and has been designed to help organisations and partnerships work through possible changes that they can make to prevent homelessness at the earliest opportunity, including when the presenting issue is not identified as having an obvious link to homelessness. 


    The toolkit gives you a step by step approach to identifying what the issues and gaps are for the people you work with and how you can help to tackle those issues and gaps.
    You do not have to work in a specialist housing or homelessness organisation to use this toolkit. Any organisation or business can make a contribution to preventing homelessness.

    We recommend that you start by downloading and reading the [Roundtable Approach toolkit guide](/assets/resources/c2c/c2c-roundtable-slides.pptx). This gives you the background information you'll need to get started.


    Once you've read it you may come to the conclusion that you want to use the alternative version we have prepared with a case study for you to use, in which case look at the [Case Study Approach toolkit guide](/assets/resources/c2c/c2c-case-study-slides.pptx).


    For both approaches there are sets of Powerpoint slides, with instructions in the notes section.


    All the materials have been designed to maximise their accessibility and ease of use electronically so you should not have to print the main documents.


    Finally, there is a set of templates for you to download and use and an explanation of the process for awarding organisations the C2C logo.
