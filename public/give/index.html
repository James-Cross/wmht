        <p>
<p>The number of people sleeping rough on our streets has increased significantly in recent years.</p>
<p>The knock on effect is increased pressure on the support network that helps rough sleepers, teams that are committed to working with individuals to provide accommodation, hot meals, medical treatment and ultimately a better future.</p>
<p>Thatâ€™s why we invite you to join us in working together so that every member of the community can turn small change into big change.</p>
