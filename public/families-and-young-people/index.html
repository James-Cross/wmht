<p>The numbers of families and young people who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless across the region is significant.</p>
<p>The Homelessness Taskforce’s Children, Families and Young People’s Task Group is working with a wide range of partners to lead the contribution to and promotion of Designing out Homelessness for children, families and young people in the WMCA region.</p>
<p>The main focus of the group is to promote and encourage early prevention activity that leads to a reduction in the number and time households spend in temporary accommodation; and an increase in the number of households in secure and affordable accommodation.</p>
<p>The group has been curating examples of effective practice in prevention and sharing those examples across the region, commissioning research on key issues such as use of Temporary Accommodation and  promoting joint working between agencies.</p>
<p>Women experiencing Domestic Abuse are at significant risk of homelessness, with DA consistently featuring as one of the top three reasons for homeless applications to local authorities in our region.</p>
<p>We have included work on Domestic Abuse as an integral part of the CFYP group and have been working with partners across housing, criminal justice and related areas to begin the work of influencing practice and promoting effective housing led responses to this critical issue.</p>
<p>An important part of the early work of the group has been to explore effective ways of promoting gender responsive trauma informed approaches to supporting women affected by DA and homelessness.</p>
