      <h2 class="h2">Positve Pathways Model</h2>
      <p>
<p>The Positive Pathway Model underpins all the work of the Homelessness Taskforce it provides us with a systematic and coherent way of thinking about how things can be done differently.</p>

      <p>
<p>The Commitment to Collaborate (C2C) is a step-by-step approach that uses the logic of both the Positive Pathways Model and Designing out Homelessness to guide organisations through a reflective yet action based process so they can maximise their impact on reducing homelessness.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Businesses</h2>
      <p>
<p>The business community has a crucial role to play in helping to reduce homelessness, both as employers and people committed to their local communities. The toolkit developed with businesses is a step-by-step guide for employers to review what they can do to maximise their contribution.</p>

      <p>
<p>Faith and Community groups have a crucial role to play in reducing homelessness and its impact of people.  They can be critical partners in work at all stages of the Positive Pathways Model approach.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Children, Families and Young People</h2>
      <p>
<p>The impact of homelessness of children, families and young people cannot be underestimated and the complexity of the issues they face can be daunting.  We have been developing our work in this area for the last two years and will keep these groups as a high priority in the future.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">No Recourse to Public Funds (NRPF)</h2>
      <p>
<p>People who have no recourse to public funds or who only have restricted access to public funds can be some of the most vulnerable individuals agencies have to support.  We have worked with key partners to collate a range of resources people can use to make a difference.</p>

  <section class="container">
    <div>
      <h2 class="h2">Rough Sleeping</h2>
      <p>
<p>If homelessness is the ultimate exclusion then rough sleeping is probably the most extreme example of that.  The Homelessness Taskforce has focused on this area of work since itâ€™s inception in 2017 and in this section we outline the work we have undertaken.</p>
