          <h3 class="h3">What is the WMCA Homelessness Taskforce?</h3>
          <p>
<p>Following the election of Andy Street as Mayor of the West Midlands in 2017, the Homelessness Taskforce was established with a commitment to bring together organisations, people and resources to tackle homelessness.</p>
<p>Today, the Taskforce Steering Group comprises all seven constituent local authorities, key public sector agencies, voluntary and community sector organisations and representation from the business community. In addition, there is a <a href="#">Members Advisory Group</a> made up of Cabinet Members with responsibility for homelessness from each of the seven constituent authorities, bolstering political leadership and accountability.</p>
<p>The Homelessness Taskforce’s central aim is to <a href="/designing-out-homelessness">design out homelessness</a>, in all its forms, by identifying gaps in strategies, policies, procedures, laws, structures, systems and relationships that either cause or fail to prevent homelessness. The purpose of the Taskforce has been to identify conditions for systems change by addressing these gaps.</p>

          <h3 class="h3">What have we achieved so far?</h3>
          <p>
<p>In the 5 years since the Taskforce’s inception in 2017 the environment in which we have been working has changed dramatically and the pressures on households and services has increased.</p>
<p>Covid-19 and subsequent lockdowns had significant impacts on both what organisations were focused on and how they worked to tackle emerging challenges.  During the periods of lockdown and restricted social contact we continued to support partners to deliver outcomes for households at risk of homelessness.  We also captured <a href="#">learning</a> from the region’s collective response to the Everyone In initiative and <a href="#">analysed</a> how practice and systems had adapted in positive ways to help overcome the significant challenges presented by Covid – 19.</p>
<p>More recently, the rises in inflation, fuel and other critical factors  have contributed to creating a cost of living crisis that we are still in the midst of; and crucially are yet to see the full impact of.</p>
<p>Despite these system wide shocks the Homelessness Taskforce and its partners have continued delivering the Taskforce’s ‘plan on a page’,  making  significant contributions to our ambition of designing out homelessness across the  region.  A few examples of our joint work include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Agreeing a West Midlands <a href="https://www.wmca.org.uk/news/west-midlands-becomes-first-region-to-re-define-affordable-housing/">definition</a> of what affordable housing is - one that reflects local incomes both from work and benefits to maximise the level of affordable housing within developments</li>
<li>Attracting additional funding for the region to tackle homelessness through the Rough Sleeping Initiative (RSI), Rough Sleeping Accommodation Programme (RSAP) and Housing First</li>
<li>Using Adult Education Budget flexibilities to run sector-based work academies specifically for roles in homelessness, focusing on transferable skills for available jobs​</li>
<li>Publishing IAG resources for veterans, faith and community organisations, and businesses to maximise their impact in designing out homelessness</li>
<li>Rolling out <a href="https://changeintoaction.org.uk/">Change into Action</a> in 6 local authority areas, supporting circa 500 individuals to move away from rough sleeping</li>
<li>Investing in <a href="https://streetsupport.net/wm">Street Support Network</a> across the region</li>
<li>Dissemination of and support to use the <a href="/commitment-to-collaborate">C2C Toolkit</a></li>
</ul>

        <h3 class="h3">Our plans – 2023 and beyond</h3>
        <p>
<p>As we look forward our ambition to design out homelessness remains our overarching objective.</p>
<p>As part of that we will continue to support the work of local authorities on ending rough sleeping at the same time as we increase our efforts across all areas of homelessness. For example, by building on the early work of the Children, Families and Young People’s and Domestic Abuse Task Groups.</p>
<p>We will continue working with existing and new partners to redouble our efforts to promote, encourage and embed system change across the WMCA region wherever we can. To help us do that we will be seeking out new partners and networks that might not focus on homelessness currently but that have a critical prevention contribution to make, for example building on the work we have recently started with the Children’s Services Early Help network.</p>
<p>We are under no illusions that achieving our objective will be easy in the current environment but we are hopeful that the commitment of key partners to collaborate and create systemic change can be nurtured as we all seek to prevent the ultimate exclusion that is homelessness.</p>
