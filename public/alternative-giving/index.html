        <p>
<p>We all want to help reduce the impact of rough sleeping at the same time as we work to reduce the numbers of people who end up living on the streets. One of the ways we can help in an effective way is by using &lsquo;alternative giving&rsquo; schemes rather than giving money to people individually.</p>
<p>That’s why we invite you to join us in working together so that every member of the community can turn small change into big change.</p>

          <h3>Change into action</h3>
          <p>
<p><a href="https://changeintoaction.org.uk">Change into Action</a> is an alternative giving scheme that provides a safe, easy and secure way to donate money to fund practical support for people who are or have been rough sleeping across the WMCA region. Change into Action brings together partners from key local organisations, such as specialist homelessness charities and street teams that work with individuals to identify practical measures that can really make a difference and help make that move away from the streets.</p>
<p>The scheme is administered and managed locally in Birmingham, Coventry, Dudley, Sandwell, Solihull and Walsall; with Wolverhampton having a similar initiative known as <a href="https://wolverhamptonchange.co.uk">Alternative Giving CIO</a>.</p>

          <h3>Give to organisations</h3>
          <p>
<p>Local community and charitable organisations are the frontline of our response to homelessness. Their staff and volunteers work tirelessly, and a donation to them can make a huge difference to what they are able to achieve.</p>
<p>To see what organisations are active in your area, go to the <a href="https://streetsupport.net/give-help">Street Support website</a>.</p>
